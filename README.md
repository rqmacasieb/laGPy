# laGPy
Python implementation of local approximate GP (laGP) based on the methods of Gramacy (2016)
laGP approximates GP regression by finding local designs to predict GP outputs at some untried inputs.

A complete documentation about laGP and an associated R package can be found in:
*Gramacy, R. B. (2016). LaGP: Large-scale spatial modeling via local approximate Gaussian processes in R. Journal of Statistical Software, 72 . doi: 10.18637/jss.v072.i01 
*CRAN https://bobby.gramacy.com/r_packages/laGP/

This version currently only does ALC method for choosing local designs.
